README for "libdvbpsi"


Introduction
============

The libdvbpsi is part of the VideoLAN project, a full MPEG2
client/server solution. The libdvbpsi can also be used with extra
programs that need DVB and PSI decoders and generators.

The VideoLAN team decided to write the libdvbpsi to make the VideoLAN
Client and the VideoLAN Server capable of demultiplexing a satellite
DVB stream. The library aims at making it easy to decode PSI tables
(such as PAT, PMT etc.) present in a TS/DVB stream.
